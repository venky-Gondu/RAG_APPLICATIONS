Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n",
      "Q-learning at its simplest stores data in tables. This approach falters with increasing numbers of states/actions since the likelihood of the agent visiting a particular state and performing a particular action is increasingly small. \n",
      "Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the long term reward, whose feedback might be incomplete or delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), because many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context use dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process and they target large Markov decision processes where exact methods become infeasible.\n",

The distance from the anchor to the positive is minimized, and the distance from the anchor to the negative input is maximized.\n",
      "An early formulation equivalent to triplet loss was introduced (without the idea of using anchors) for metric learning from relative comparisons by M. Schultze and T. Joachims in 2003.\n",
      "By enforcing the order of distances, triplet loss models embed in the way that a pair of samples with same labels are smaller in distance than those with different labels. Unlike t-SNE which preserves embedding orders  via probability distributions, triplet loss works directly on embedded distances. Therefore, in its common implementation, it needs soft margin treatment with a slack variable \n",

      "Consider the task of training a neural network to recognize faces (e.g. for admission to a high security zone). A classifier trained to classify an instance would have to be retrained every time a new person is added to the face database. This can be avoided by posing the problem as a similarity learning problem instead of a classification problem. Here the network is trained (using a contrastive loss) to output a distance which is small if the image belongs to a known person and large if the image belongs to an unknown person. However, if we want to output the closest images to a given image, we want to learn a ranking and not just a similarity. A triplet loss is used in this case.\n",

Linked data structures are thus contrasted with arrays and other data structures that require performing arithmetic operations on pointers.  This distinction holds even when the nodes are actually implemented as elements of a single array, and the references are actually array indices: as long as no arithmetic is done on those indices, the data structure is essentially a linked one.\n",

An RTOS is distinct from a time-sharing operating system, such as Unix, which manages the sharing of system resources with a scheduler, data buffers, or fixed task prioritization in multitasking or multiprogramming environments. All operations must verifiably complete within given time and resource constraints or else fail safe. Real-time operating systems are event-driven and preemptive, meaning the OS can monitor the relevant priority of competing tasks, and make changes to the task priority. Event-driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities, while time-sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts.\n",

      "Summary: A transformer is a deep learning architecture developed by researchers at Google and based on the multi-head attention mechanism, proposed in a 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via looking up from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\n",
      "Transformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, and therefore require less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets, such as the Wikipedia corpus and Common Crawl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since then. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multi-modal processing, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Attention (machine learning)\n",
      "Summary: Attention is a machine learning method that determines the relative importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that sequence. In natural language processing, importance is represented by \"soft\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size.\n",
      "Unlike \"hard\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \"soft\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network language translation system, but the later transformer design removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme.\n",
      "Inspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\n",

      "Summary: Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is a language model introduced in October 2018 by researchers at Google. It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. It is notable for its dramatic improvement over previous state-of-the-art models, and as an early example of a large language model. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \n",
      "BERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Transformer Model:** This is the heart of the explanation, a revolutionary architecture for natural language processing (NLP) that has replaced recurrent neural networks in many tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Attention Mechanisms:**  The real magic lies here. These are like focused \"mirrors\" within the model. They analyze relationships between words and predict how they fit into the sentence structure. \n",
      "    * **Encoder Attention:** This component analyzes the entire input sequence to understand context and meaning, like looking at all the sentences before you build your own.\n",
      "    * **Decoder Attention:**  This helps generate the output sequence by focusing on what's already been built on during the encoding process, ensuring each word in the output aligns with what came before it. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Self-Attention Layers (Specifically Layer 5):** This is a deeper dive into how these attention mechanisms work. The model uses \"multi-headed self-attention\" to capture diverse relationships within the input sequence. Each head essentially focuses on different aspects of the sentence, making it robust and adaptable. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact:**\n",
      "* **Speed:**  Transformers train faster than traditional models because they can process information more efficiently. This means generating better quality translations, like for English-to-German or English-to-French, in less time.\n",
      "* **Performance:** The model consistently achieves top-notch results, exceeding previous state-of-the-art benchmarks, especially on machine translation tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Future Directions:**\n",
      "The authors aim to expand the capabilities of attention-based models by:\n",
      "    * Using it for more modalities (beyond text – images, audio, video)\n",
      "    * Exploring local and restricted attention mechanisms for efficient processing of large inputs/outputs.\n",
      "    *  Making generation less sequential. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Attention is the Key:** Transformers are designed to understand the relationship between words in a sentence by leveraging attention mechanisms. This leads to improved translation accuracy and efficiency.\n",
      "2. **More Than Just Translation:** The Transformer model's versatility extends beyond just translation, with potential for use in image captioning, speech recognition, and more.\n",
      "3. **Continued Research & Development:** As the focus shifts towards multi-modality understanding and efficient generation, we can expect even greater progress and advancement in this field. \n",
