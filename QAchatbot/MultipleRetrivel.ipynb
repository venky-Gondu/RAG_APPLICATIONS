Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n",
      "Q-learning at its simplest stores data in tables. This approach falters with increasing numbers of states/actions since the likelihood of the agent visiting a particular state and performing a particular action is increasingly small. \n",
      "Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the long term reward, whose feedback might be incomplete or delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), because many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context use dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process and they target large Markov decision processes where exact methods become infeasible.\n",

The distance from the anchor to the positive is minimized, and the distance from the anchor to the negative input is maximized.\n",
      "An early formulation equivalent to triplet loss was introduced (without the idea of using anchors) for metric learning from relative comparisons by M. Schultze and T. Joachims in 2003.\n",
      "By enforcing the order of distances, triplet loss models embed in the way that a pair of samples with same labels are smaller in distance than those with different labels. Unlike t-SNE which preserves embedding orders  via probability distributions, triplet loss works directly on embedded distances. Therefore, in its common implementation, it needs soft margin treatment with a slack variable \n",

      "Consider the task of training a neural network to recognize faces (e.g. for admission to a high security zone). A classifier trained to classify an instance would have to be retrained every time a new person is added to the face database. This can be avoided by posing the problem as a similarity learning problem instead of a classification problem. Here the network is trained (using a contrastive loss) to output a distance which is small if the image belongs to a known person and large if the image belongs to an unknown person. However, if we want to output the closest images to a given image, we want to learn a ranking and not just a similarity. A triplet loss is used in this case.\n",

Linked data structures are thus contrasted with arrays and other data structures that require performing arithmetic operations on pointers.  This distinction holds even when the nodes are actually implemented as elements of a single array, and the references are actually array indices: as long as no arithmetic is done on those indices, the data structure is essentially a linked one.\n",

An RTOS is distinct from a time-sharing operating system, such as Unix, which manages the sharing of system resources with a scheduler, data buffers, or fixed task prioritization in multitasking or multiprogramming environments. All operations must verifiably complete within given time and resource constraints or else fail safe. Real-time operating systems are event-driven and preemptive, meaning the OS can monitor the relevant priority of competing tasks, and make changes to the task priority. Event-driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities, while time-sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts.\n",
